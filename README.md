Here’s the updated version based on your request:

**Suggestion for Improvement:**

In the current system, there is a popup displaying all employees in a grid with options to select or multi-select employees and assign them.

I suggest adding a switch toggle at the top of the popup with two values: "Assigned" and "Unassigned." When the toggle is set to "Assigned," it will display employees who are already assigned to other agencies. When the toggle is set to "Unassigned," it will display employees who are not assigned to any other agency.

This change will simplify the process of managing employees, as users can focus on one action at a time. For instance, when the toggle is on "Assigned," users can view and manage employees already assigned to other agencies. When it’s on "Unassigned," users can assign employees who are not yet assigned to any agency.

This should now align with the functionality you're describing.

It seems like you're trying to handle reCAPTCHA V2 in your Angular app, and you're encountering issues where:

1. The CAPTCHA sometimes completes automatically without showing the puzzle.
2. You want to ensure that the puzzle is always displayed, and also you need a way to reset the widget properly.

Here’s how to address both these problems:

### 1. **Forcing the Puzzle to Appear Every Time**
   The default behavior of reCAPTCHA V2 is to sometimes skip the puzzle if Google believes that the user is human (based on prior interactions, browser history, etc.). This behavior can be changed by using the `data-size="invisible"` or `data-size="compact"` options.

   **Solution:** To force the puzzle to appear every time, set the `data-size` attribute to `normal`. This will force the challenge to appear more often.

   ```html
   <div
     #recaptchaElement
     class="g-recaptcha"
     data-sitekey="your-site-key"
     data-size="normal"  <!-- This will show the puzzle more often -->
     data-callback="handleCaptchaSuccess">
   </div>
   ```

   By using `data-size="normal"`, the puzzle will appear more frequently rather than bypassing the puzzle for verified users.

### 2. **Resetting the reCAPTCHA and Token**

   You can reset the reCAPTCHA widget using `grecaptcha.reset()` method as I mentioned earlier. Here's an extended way to reset the child, the token, and the widget.

   In your component, you can do the following:

   ```typescript
   triggerCaptcha() {
     if (this.captchaRef) {
       // Execute reCAPTCHA
       this.captchaRef.execute();
       this.isLoginButtonDisabled = false;
     } else {
       console.error("reCAPTCHA reference is not available");
     }
   }

   // Handle resolved v2 token
   handleRecaptchaV2Resolved(captchaResponse: string): void {
     this.recaptchaV2Token = AngularExtended.cloneDeep(captchaResponse); // Store token
     // Manually reset the reCAPTCHA widget and clear the stored token after some action
     this.resetRecaptcha(); // Call reset after token is obtained
   }

   // Reset the reCAPTCHA widget and clear stored token
   resetRecaptcha(): void {
     if (this.captchaRef) {
       grecaptcha.reset(this.captchaRef); // Reset the reCAPTCHA widget
     }
     this.recaptchaV2Token = null; // Clear the stored token
   }
   ```

   In the above code:
   - After obtaining the `captchaResponse` in `handleRecaptchaV2Resolved()`, you store the token.
   - You then reset the reCAPTCHA widget and clear the token using `resetRecaptcha()`.

### 3. **Ensuring Puzzle is Always Displayed**

   To force reCAPTCHA to always show the puzzle when `execute()` is called, you can manually reset it before invoking the puzzle trigger, which ensures that no cached result (token) is used.

   Here's how you can reset and trigger reCAPTCHA in sequence:

   ```typescript
   triggerCaptcha() {
     if (this.captchaRef) {
       this.resetRecaptcha(); // Reset to ensure puzzle is always displayed
       this.captchaRef.execute(); // Trigger reCAPTCHA
       this.isLoginButtonDisabled = false;
     } else {
       console.error("reCAPTCHA reference is not available");
     }
   }
   ```

   By resetting the reCAPTCHA widget each time before executing it, you ensure that the challenge is fresh and it won’t rely on any previous responses.

### 4. **Ensure Widget Rendering Completes Properly**

   If you are facing issues where the puzzle is not displayed, it could be related to the widget not rendering correctly. You can add checks to ensure that the widget has rendered before calling `execute()`:

   ```typescript
   checkAndTriggerCaptcha() {
     if (this.captchaRef && typeof grecaptcha !== 'undefined') {
       // Check if the reCAPTCHA widget is rendered
       if (grecaptcha.getResponse(this.captchaRef) === '') {
         this.captchaRef.execute();
       } else {
         console.warn("reCAPTCHA already has a response, resetting...");
         this.resetRecaptcha();
         this.captchaRef.execute();
       }
     } else {
       console.error("reCAPTCHA reference is not available or not loaded");
     }
   }
   ```

### Summary:

- **Force puzzle**: Use `data-size="normal"` to force the reCAPTCHA puzzle to appear more often.
- **Reset reCAPTCHA and token**: Use `grecaptcha.reset()` to reset the reCAPTCHA widget and clear any stored token. Always reset before calling `execute()` to ensure a new challenge is generated.
- **Ensure proper rendering**: Add checks to confirm the reCAPTCHA widget is rendered before trying to trigger it.

This approach should help you manage the reCAPTCHA lifecycle better and resolve the issues you're encountering with automatic token generation without the puzzle appearing.
